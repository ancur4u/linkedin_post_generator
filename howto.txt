make sure you create a ".env" file to record all API keys specifically OPENAI_API_KEY in following format:
OPENAI_API_KEY=
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
USER_AGENT="Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)"


and then run -> ./setup_python_project.sh
This will create a venv python environment to run the following command from terminal:
streamlit run linkedin_post.py
